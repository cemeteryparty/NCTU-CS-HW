# 2019 Spring Digital Design

## Description
Labworks of NCTU 2019 Spring Digital Design.

## Environment
Follow the instruction in class, we can Download and use ModelSim in this labwork. However, the steps of installation and registration of ModelSim is complicated. I choose Icarus Verilog + GTKWave instead.

You can see the detail in [lab0](lab0/).
